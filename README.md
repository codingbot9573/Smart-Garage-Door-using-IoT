# Smart-Garage-Door-using-IoT
This project includes WIFI (Esp8266/IOT module) which is connected to Arduino through UART interface. DC motor connected Arduino through H-bride IC (L293d). DC motor attached with some mechanism acts like door. Two IR sensors connected to Arduino and placed at open/close position to know door open or close.
